                        **Important Guidelines to analyse the action**:
                        - Identify each player's **MOVEMENTS** and **POSITIONING**.

                        - **IMAGINE YOU ARE LIVE ON AIR** describing this moment in real time.
                        - Your commentary will be **converted into an audio track using a text-to-speech model**.
                        - Your output must be **AS NATURAL, EMOTIONAL, and HUMAN as POSSIBLE**, with the **RIGHT LEVEL OF EXCITEMENT**.
                        - **Your commentary must fit exactly within 10 seconds**, so **BE CONCISE YET DESCRIPTIVE**.
                        - **Follow the exact chronology of the action**, as if you were watching and reacting to it live.
                        - Use **VERY SHORT AND ENERGETIC SENTENCES**, avoid unnecessary introductions.
                        - **Generate ONLY ONE version** of the commentary‚Äîdo NOT provide multiple variations or repeat the same event.
                        - **DO NOT include extra labels like "Commentary:" or explanations about what you are doing.**
                        - **DO NOT REPEAT THE TIMESTAMPS** you see in the description.
                        - **USE THE MATCH CONTEXT and the jersey-to-team association** to name the players (e.g., "the Tottenham player").
                        - **IF a described jersey color does NOT match the match context, IGNORE it** and use the correct team.
                        - **Cover the entire action sequence within 10 seconds, ensuring a fluid progression from start to finish.**
                        - **ONCE THE COMMENTARY IS COMPLETE, STOP GENERATING IMMEDIATELY.**

                        **Example Style (for a penalty goal)**:
                        - "The Tottenham player steps up... he shoots‚ÄîGOOOAL! The keeper dives the wrong way! What a finish!"

RESULTS:
{'1 - 01:34': "### Video Clip Analysis: Throw-in\n\n#### Scene Description:\nThe video clip captures a throw-in action in a soccer match. The sequence begins with the ball being thrown into play by one of the players. The camera angle is positioned at a medium distance, providing a clear view of the throw-in area and the immediate vicinity around it. The field is well-lit, suggesting that the match is taking place during the day under stadium lights.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The ball is stationary on the ground near the corner flag.\n   - A player from the attacking team (let's call them Team A) is preparing to take the throw-in. This player is standing outside the penalty area, holding the ball with both hands behind their head.\n   - The defending team (Team B) is positioned around the throw-in spot, ready to react to the throw-in.\n\n2. **Throw-In Execution:**\n   - The player from Team A throws the ball into the air with both hands, ensuring it crosses the sideline.\n   - The ball is thrown with a moderate force, aiming to reach the center of the field.\n   - As the ball is released, the camera follows its trajectory, maintaining focus on the ball and the immediate area around the throw-in spot.\n\n3. **Ball's Trajectory:**\n   - The ball travels through the air, curving slightly due to the thrower's technique.\n   - Upon reaching the intended target, the ball lands on the ground within the field of play.\n   - The ball's landing point is near the center of the field, close to the halfway line.\n\n4. **Interactions Between Players:**\n   - As the ball is thrown, players from both teams begin to move towards it, anticipating possession.\n   - A defender from Team B jumps to intercept the ball, but the thrower from Team A manages to control the ball before it reaches the defender.\n   - The thrower from Team A quickly passes the ball to a teammate who is positioned further up the field, likely looking to create an offensive opportunity.\n\n5. **Tactical Positioning:**\n   - The attacking team (Team A) has positioned themselves strategically to capitalize on the throw-in. The thrower is positioned outside the penalty area, while other teammates are spread out across the field, ready to receive the pass.\n   - The defending team (Team B) has positioned themselves to contest the throw-in, with defenders and midfielders forming a defensive wall around the throw-in"}

The camera angle is a wide shot that covers the entire penalty box, allowing us to see all players involved in the play.\n\n---\n\n#### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Play (0-2 seconds):**\n   - **Midfielder (Attacking Team):** The midfielder receives the ball near the halfway line and starts dribbling towards the penalty area. His movements are quick and agile, evading defenders.\n   - **Defender (Defending Team):** A defender from the defending team attempts to intercept the ball but fails due to the midfielder's skillful dribbling.\n   - **Ball Trajectory:** The ball is initially passed forward by the midfielder, then deflected slightly to the right as he maneuvers past the defender.\n   - **Camera Angle:** The camera remains static, providing a clear view of the midfield action as the ball enters the penalty area.\n\n2. **Penalty Area Play (2-4 seconds):**\n   - **Midfielder (Attacking Team):** As the ball reaches the penalty area, the midfielder passes the ball to a forward who is positioned near the edge of the box.\n   - **Forward (Attacking Team):** The forward receives the ball and takes a few steps back before passing the ball to another attacker positioned deeper inside the box.\n   - **Defender (Defending Team):** A defender from the defending team tries to press the forward but is unable to intercept the pass.\n   - **Ball Trajectory:** The ball is passed horizontally across the penalty area, moving from one attacker to another.\n   - **Camera Angle:** The camera angle shifts slightly to follow the movement of the ball as it crosses the penalty area.\n\n3. **Final Pass (4-6 seconds):**\n   - **Attacker (Attacking Team):** The ball is received by an attacker who is positioned near the penalty spot. This attacker has a clear view of the goal and decides to take a shot.\n   - **Defender (Defending Team):** A defender from the defending team attempts to block the shot but is too late.\n   - **Ball Trajectory:** The ball is shot directly at the goal, and the goalkeeper dives to make a save but misses the ball.\n   - **Camera Angle:** The camera zooms in"}

# action_context =f"""You are an expert video analyst for soccer matches.
#                 We have identified an important key action in the game, classified as: **{clip['label']}**. You will analyze a **{clip_length}-second video clip (25 FPS)** that captures this action.
#                 Your goal is to provide a **highly detailed, chronological, and timestamped description** of what happens during the clip so that a language model can later generate a rich and accurate spoken commentary.

#                 ---

#                 **Important Instructions:**
#                 1. **Use the full set of frames provided** (‚âà30 frames sampled at 3 FPS).
#                 Group your analysis into 1-second chunks (3 frames = 1 second). Use headings like: **Time: 0s‚Äì1s**, **1s‚Äì2s**, etc.
#                 Within each section, summarize what happens in those frames ‚Äî DO NOT repeat the same description.

#                 4. **TRACKING HELP (Visual Annotations)**:
#                 - **Players** are highlighted with **orange ellipses**.
#                 - **Referees** have **yellow ellipses**.
#                 - **Goalkeepers** are marked with **blue ellipses**.
#                 - The **ball** is highlighted in **purple**, but **this tracking is often unreliable**. Use it only as a **clue**, not a definitive source.

#                 5. **Jersey Colors for Team Identification**:
#                 - Describe players using their **jersey colors** (e.g., "white jersey player passes to a dark blue jersey forward").

#                 6. **WHAT TO DESCRIBE**:
#                 - **Player movements and positioning**.
#                 - **Ball trajectory**: passes, interceptions, shots, clearances.
#                 - **Interactions**: tackles, duels, assists, defensive pressure.
#                 - **Context**: referee signals, player gestures, group reactions (celebration, disappointment, etc.).

#                 **FORMAT REQUIREMENTS**:
#                 - Be **objective, structured, and vivid**.
#                 - DO NOT summarize‚Äî**focus on each action** with **granularity** and clarity.
#                 - Avoid any speculation; base your description only on what is **visibly happening** in the video.
#                 - You can use bullet points or paragraphs, but it must follow a **timeline**.

#                 Your output will be used by another model to generate **spoken sport commentary**, so your analysis must be clear, exhaustive, and grounded in the actual content of the video.
